# Project Setup with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Scripts You Can Run

In the project folder, you have access to the following commands:

### `yarn start`

This will launch the app in development mode.<br />
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload when you modify the code.<br />
You can also view lint warnings and errors directly in the console.

### `yarn test`

Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />


### `yarn build`

Compiles the app for production, outputting it to the `build` directory.<br />
This ensures React is bundled in production mode, optimizing the output for better performance.

The output is minified and filenames will include hashes for caching purposes.<br />
Your app will then be ready for deployment!


### `yarn eject`

**Important: This action is irreversible. Once you eject, it cannot be undone!**

If you want more control over the project’s configuration (such as webpack, Babel, or ESLint), running `yarn eject` will remove the single build dependency, copying all configuration files and dependencies directly into your project.

You’ll still be able to run the usual commands, but they’ll now use the copied scripts, which you can customize further. Once you eject, you are fully responsible for managing the build setup.

### Note: Ejection is optional

Ejection is not required for most users. The default setup is tailored for small to mid-sized applications, and most developers will never need to eject. But if you require customization beyond the defaults, this option is available.
